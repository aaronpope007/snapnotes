# Poker Notes App — Cursor Rules

## Project Overview
This is a compact poker player notes app. Frontend is React + Vite + TypeScript (SWC) with MUI dark theme. Backend is Node/Express with Mongoose + MongoDB Atlas. The app is designed to be narrow (~400px wide) and used alongside poker tables.

## Code Style
- Always use TypeScript. No `any` types — define proper interfaces/types in `src/types/`.
- Use functional components and hooks only. No class components.
- Keep components small and single-responsibility. If a component exceeds ~150 lines, suggest splitting it.
- Use MUI components for all UI — do not introduce additional CSS frameworks or component libraries.
- Use `axios` for all API calls, centralized in `src/api/`.

## Architecture Rules
- The frontend never talks directly to MongoDB. All data goes through the Express API.
- All Mongoose models live in `server/models/`. All routes live in `server/routes/`.
- Environment variables are never hardcoded. Always reference `process.env.*` and ensure the variable is in `.env.example`.
- The Vite proxy handles `/api` routing — never hardcode `localhost:5000` in frontend code.

## Behavior Rules
- When modifying an existing file, preserve all existing functionality unless explicitly told to change it.
- Do not remove error handling or loading states when editing components.
- When adding a new feature, check if a relevant type already exists in `src/types/` before creating a new one.
- Always handle API errors gracefully with a MUI Snackbar notification.

## Styling Rules
- Use MUI dark theme throughout. Do not override the theme with inline styles unless absolutely necessary.
- The `**` prefix in notes always renders in amber/gold color. Do not change this behavior.
- Player type colors are defined once (in a constants file) and referenced everywhere — do not hardcode colors inline.

## Out of Scope (Do Not Build)
- No shorthand-to-image conversion feature.
- No authentication or user accounts.
- No always-on-top or floating window behavior.
